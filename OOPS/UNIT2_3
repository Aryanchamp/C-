Preethi is developing an input processing module for a chatbot. Implement a program that reads user input and counts the number of words to analyze the user's query. Utilize the pointer-to-pointer concept to process the input and count the words.

Input format :
The input consists of a list of words/sentences as string.

Output format :
The output prints the count of the words that are present in the given sentence/sentences.



﻿Refer to the sample output for formatting specifications.

Code constraints :
In this scenario, the test cases fall under the following constraints:

1 ≤ Total number of characters in the sentence(s) ≤ 1000

Sample test cases :
Input 1 :
Hi, how are you? Hope this code helps you to learn. Happy Learning!! - 01245
Output 1 :
15
Input 2 :
hello world
Output 2 :
2

// You are using GCC
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

using namespace std;

int main(){
    
    string a; 
    getline(cin, a);
    
    int count = 0; 
    bool inword = false;
    
    for (int i = 0; i < a.length(); i++){
        if (a[i] != ' '){
            if(!inword){
                count++;
                inword = true;
            }
        } else {
            inword = false;
        }
    } 
cout << count;
