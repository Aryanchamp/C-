Emma has a collection of unique plant species in her garden. She wants to check if a particular plant is already in her collection. 



Help Emma by writing a program using a linear search algorithm that determines if the plant species is in her collection.

Input format :
The first line of input consists of an integer n, representing the number of plant species.

The second line consists of n space-separated integers, representing the plant species IDs in Emma's collection.

The third line consists of an integer representing the target plant species ID.

Output format :
The output prints whether the target plant species ID is present in the collection or not.



Refer to the sample output for the exact format.

Code constraints :
1 ≤ n ≤ 25

1 ≤ species ID, target ≤ 100

Sample test cases :
Input 1 :
5
6 8 7 4 2
2
Output 1 :
Plant species 2 is present in the collection
Input 2 :
5
6 8 7 4 2
1
Output 2 :
Plant species 1 is not present in the collection
