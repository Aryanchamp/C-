Alice is preparing for a coding competition and wants to practice her skills with linked lists. She decides to write a program that allows her to create a linked list by inserting elements at the front. 



Help Alice with her task.



Company tags: HCL

Input format :
The first line of input consists of an integer n, representing the number of elements to be inserted.

The second line of input consists of n space-separated integers, representing the elements to be inserted in the linked list.

The third line of input consists of an integer m, representing the value to be inserted at the front of the linked list.

Output format :
The first line of output displays "Created Linked list: " followed by the elements of the linked list.

The second line of output displays "Final List: " followed by the elements of the linked list after inserting the new element at the front.



Refer to the sample output for formatting specifications.

Code constraints :
In this scenario, the test cases fall under the following constraints:

1 ≤ n ≤ 10

1 ≤ elements, m ≤ 100

Sample test cases :
Input 1 :
5
6 5 4 3 2
1
Output 1 :
Created Linked list: 2 3 4 5 6 
Final List: 1 2 3 4 5 6 
Input 2 :
4
-10 20 -30 40
5
Output 2 :
Created Linked list: 40 -30 20 -10 
Final List: 5 40 -30 20 -10
